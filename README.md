# Unlocking-Olympic-Data
This project focuses on analyzing the 120 years of Olympics history dataset using SQL queries. The dataset consists of two tables: "dataset_olympics.csv" and "noc_region.csv". The "dataset_olympics" table contains information about athletes, their teams, the Olympic Games they participated in, and the medals they won. The "noc_region" table provides the mapping between the National Olympic Committee codes (NOC) and the corresponding regions. By cleaning the dataset using Python and Pandas, the project aims to ensure data quality.

* Analyzed 120 years of Olympics history dataset using SQL queries, focusing on athlete information, teams, Olympic Games participation, and medal
achievements.
* Conducted quality assurance checks on data to ensure accuracy and completeness, followed by data preprocessing to enhance analysis capabilities using Python.
* Derived valuable insights, including medal counts, participation statistics, top-performing athletes, countries, and sports where specific nations excelled.
